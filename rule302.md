# Rule

Quorum is half of all active, registered [Players](https://github.com/mburns/nomic/wiki/Player). Active is defined as having voting or joined within the last year.

The required number of votes for a rule-change proposal is two-thirds of the legal votes cast on it.

Each player has exactly one vote on each proposal. The prescribed voting period is thirty days.
